# Quilljoy: Beautiful collaborative editing that mostly works

*(stab 2)*

All the code in here is meant as a motivating example for
[a talk on CRDTs](https://github.com/jorendorff/talks/blob/master/textarea-distributed/textarea-distributed.md).

The hope is that the risk of collaborators getting out of sync
and then scribbling randomly all over each others' work
will be self-evidently unacceptable.
And then CRDTs will seem amazing by comparison.

There are other approaches, but they all have problems.

and [Univax](https://github.com/jorendorff/univax).
